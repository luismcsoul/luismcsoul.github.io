DISSONANCE

She searches for a double sided knife,
To build a memory.
He said bring your lover to our house,
And so we all get to feel the same.
A painful promise,
Keeps the thread of the story,
To redeem the animal-rage:

Dissonance.

The idea of giving birth
Don't compensate the hurting
brought everyday by a dying love.

"I feel like I wish you had someone you liked"
