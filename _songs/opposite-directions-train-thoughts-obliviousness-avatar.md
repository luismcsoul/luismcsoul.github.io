OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS

Is not nice, not to see you, despite you being in front of me,
Poker face, black holes in your eyes,

There's no further distance than obliviousness,
Two strangers going to opposite directions,
Empty vacuum gazes and complete lack of interest,
Is when physical proximity turns damnation.

And I wasted my machine-machine-gun against your avatar...
Smashing, slashing, flashing, crashing...

Opposite Directions in the train of thoughts,
I crossed the treshold: expelled from paradise.
Opposite Directions, streams of consciousness,
Too much desperation, there's no turning back.
