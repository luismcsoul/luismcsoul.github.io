BLINDNESS

I know the reason why you hate so much this kind of place,
and I know why you feel so proudful to look at nobody,
but which kind of happiness lies under obliviousness?
Spending your time avoiding any other human gaze.

It's because you don't want to feel bothered
by the gaze of any stranger
staring at your straight in to your eyes.
That's ehy you don't take your eyes out of your
radio-tv-pc-phone-visor,
it's the white blindness described by Saramago.

If we both make faces like animals,
trapped in urban traffic lights,
and it is our perpetual reality,
to be connections, weirder every time. 

Everything to fool yourself,
about your lightweight pleasantness, 
and dettach your 'bright future' from this current time
that is always confrontational.
