WITCHES

Emoticon schism,
Delusion, disruption,
Some bytes will never return,
They are nobody's business,
nobody's prophecies.

And so like this, I approach the edge,
In the hardware-bridge of my days,
If I fall it's not your fault,
It's due to the prayers of the witches.

Its vespertine presence is the sound of the Soul Feedback.
