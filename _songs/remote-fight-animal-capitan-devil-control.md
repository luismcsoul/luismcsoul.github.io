REMOTE

We found ourselves in the middle of the fight,
that kind of rage that transforms
the animal (inside of me) in capitan (of my ship),
Out of a sudden you threatened me with
Lovers from other eras/without frontiers,
And my heart turned small and cold!

I swear, it wasn't me,
there was a shadow in the room,
Who blowed up your world:
Radio-TV-Compu-Phone-Visor.

If I tear down the wardrobe,
And If I cease to exist,
I'm wondering if the devil
had seen remote the control.
