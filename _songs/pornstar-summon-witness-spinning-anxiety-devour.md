PORNSTAR

Sun-Star:
A witness of our anxious spinning;
You're not just standing there, but
/approaching us all,
And your gaze transforms everything it touches.

I summon you!
That someone just deflated and flattened,
I summon you!
she came out with moral manichaeism.

Sun-Star:
Burning yourself in long term combustion,
at the end you'll shine even more,
expanding and absorbing us all.

I summon you!
That someone cancelled and postponed,
I summon you!
She avoided, forgot or ignored,
I summon you!
Today she's resting on her laurels.

I summon you!
Today that, with her archaic morals,
/With nothing remarkable,
/she passed unnoticed
(over this world).

Because I know the real excitement,
Of the reciprocal attitude,
That comes together with a gaze
that would like to devour the world...
I summon you!

Because I'm strong, good luck and see you never!
