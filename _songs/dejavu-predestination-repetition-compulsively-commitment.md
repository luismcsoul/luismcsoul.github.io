DEJAVU

You talk about love
And predestination
But every beginning
Is just repetition

And that's no love
That's dejavu.
Compulsively avoiding commitment
That's to return.

And every time is less intense,
Every time you need more to feel the same,
The same or less.

So don't get scared
If after moaning bodies comes destruction.
