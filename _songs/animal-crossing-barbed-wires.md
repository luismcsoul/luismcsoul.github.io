ANIMAL

I proclaim the collapse,
I announce the disruption,
I pronounce the discoloration
Of your rococo mansion.

I foresee the tumbling,
I profess the crumbling,
I promote the dismantling
Of your french pedicure.

There's no mayonnaise in my salad,
Neither in my house pasteurized milk,
The template of government in which we live in
It's just another bad copy of a French invention.

I prophesy the crumbling,
I profess the tumbling,
I enact the dismantling
Of your guillotine-esque bourgeois-congress.

I am an animal crossing barbed wires,
I am an animal crossing hungriness,
I am an animal crossing crowds,
I am an Anima + L.
