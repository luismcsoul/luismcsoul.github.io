TEARS

It seems to me that you don't know how it feels,
To have no enough strength in your heart to move your blood,
Cold sweet sinking in your skin,
The ancient calling of the sea: Tears!

It seems to me that you don't know how it feels,
A caged heart-shape and your breathing -slow,
Cold hands freezing still,
Vacuum pulling down your throat: Tears!
