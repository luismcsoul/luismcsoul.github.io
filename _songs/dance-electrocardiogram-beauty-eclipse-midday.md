DANCE

[Part I Bossa Nova]
Dance,
the sea
will survive
our rush.

Dance,
We only remember peaks
among the waves of electrocardiograms.

Dance,
that beauty is a eclipse
at midday
And it'll pass through us.

[Part II Heavy Instrumental Descarga]

[Part III With Feeling slow Son Cubano]
You make all this sea
You and this city
If you're not here
there's nothing at all...
If you're not here
The evil in me...
