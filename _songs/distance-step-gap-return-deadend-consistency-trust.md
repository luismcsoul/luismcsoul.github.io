GAP

I don't believe in words anymore,
I mirror actions and consistency,
and since I don't trust you at all
You better stay in line:

You better keep your distance mister,
You better watch your step,
You better mind the gap.

Our pictures
Will disappear
As if we were never together
In the first place.

So play the role
Of a good
Stranger:

For you
there's just One way,
No return,
Dead end.
